this method (originally found by Catakang#0987) _____ without ______ screwing you over

using ___ files, you can convince your chromebook that the wifi that you're connected to is pay-to-use (like a hotspot using data), and thus _________


<hr>
<b>to start:</b>

- go to chrome://network#state (on your school chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol)

- scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of "favorite" wifis that you've connected to in the past

- click the + sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your chromebook to
    
<b>the more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the "favorites" section</b>

- use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page

- go back to this page 

- paste the copied text into the textbox below

- press the "generate onc" button below the textbox

<hr><input placeholder="read instructions!">
    
<button onclick="gen()"><b>generate and download onc file</b></button>


- once you have downloaded the file, go to chrome://network#general

- click on the "import onc" button

- import the newly downloaded file

<b>your chromebook will no longer automatically update (as long as you are on a wifi that you used caub on)
  
be careful not to stay on a wifi for too long without using caub on it</b>
    
<hr>
<b>bonus:</b>

- go to chrome://sync-internals on the chromebook

- click "trigger getupdates"; the number of synced wifi configurations should go up

- follow the steps at the <a href="pass.html">sync internals pass</a> page
